pyramid scream server

so while watching john oliver one night, and let's be honest, I was streaming it because... well... So I was thinking about how every time I watch his show I'm inspired and outraged and passionate and getting ready for bed and forgetting most of it and the passion the next day because, life.

Now psychology teaches us that as the problem becomes bigger, our inability to confront becomes greater because, we're only one person. And that's when the idea took some shape. If in that moment of passion, we have that person jump on a site and sign up to do 2 hours of web development or lobbying or whatevs. Basically, start with a ton of people at the bottom and use them to create the pyramid from the bottom up. Which ironically enough is i think how the aliens built them :)

graphql was a pretty natural choice (although a new paradigm, true but what is life without paradigm shifts?!?!?! Not one I want to live in thank you very much! Oh no, this was just supposed to be a quick joke aside and now you've gone and--) so, so, sorry about that! He has a tendency to amuse himself. Where was i? Oh yes, graphql. Because Cool! also, challenging. Also, lots of really cool benes and ability to traverse data in cool and powerful new ways. Or so I'm learning :)
